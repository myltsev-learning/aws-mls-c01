The proportion of all correct predictions (both positive and negative) out of the total number of predictions.

$$
Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / (True Positives + True Negatives + False Positives + False Negatives)
$$

**Why it matters:** Accuracy gives an overall picture of a model's performance, but can be misleading in imbalanced datasets.
