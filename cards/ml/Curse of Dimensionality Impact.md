High dimensionality can lead to:

- **Sparsity:** Data points become scattered, making it harder to learn patterns.
- **Distance measures:** Euclidean distance becomes less meaningful in high dimensions.
- **Model complexity:** Models with many features are prone to overfitting.
- **Data requirements:** More data is needed to train effective models.
