<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Hyperparameters are variables that determine the structure and training of a neural network. They are set before training and include variables related to network structure, such as the number of hidden layers and units, and variables related to the training algorithm, such as learning rate and batch size.</mark> Hyperparameters are different from model parameters, which are configuration variables that a model learns on its own.
