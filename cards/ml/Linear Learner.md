A Linear Learner algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It's used to find a linear (straight line) relationship between input [[Feature|features]] (your data) and an output value. In higher dimensions it becomes a hyperplane. The goal is to accurately predict the output variable for new, unseen data.
