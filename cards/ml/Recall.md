Recall (also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate)

The proportion of correctly identified positive cases among all actual positive cases.
$$
Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
$$
**Why it matters:**Â High recall means the model does a great job finding all of the positive cases, minimizing missed opportunities.
