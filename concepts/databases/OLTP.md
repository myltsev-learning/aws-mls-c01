OLTP stands for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Online Transaction Processing, which is a type of data processing used for executing a large number of transactions in real-time. </mark>These transactions can include economic or financial transactions, as well as any kind of digital interaction or engagement with a business that can be triggered from anywhere in the world.

OLTP is an online data modification system that captures and maintains transaction data in a database, and is typically used for everyday transactions like ATMs, ecommerce purchases, online banking, text messages, and account changes, among many other day-to-day transactions. OLTP systems are used for real-time execution of large volumes of database transactions by large numbers of people, and typically use a relational database or SQL database to handle extensive volumes of simple transactions, enable multi-user access to the same data, process data quickly, provide index datasets for fast searches, and are available continually.

OLTP is often contrasted with online analytical processing (OLAP), which is generally characterized by much more complex queries, in a smaller volume, for the purpose of business intelligence or reporting rather than to process transactions.
