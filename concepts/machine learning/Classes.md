In machine learning classification tasks, "classes" are the distinct categories or labels that we are trying to predict. Let's consider some examples:

- **Email classification:** Classes could be "spam" and "not spam".
- **Image recognition:** Classes might be "dog", "cat", "bird", etc.
- **Medical diagnosis:** Classes could represent "ill" or "healthy".

Essentially, classes are the different possible outcomes that our machine learning model is designed to identify.
