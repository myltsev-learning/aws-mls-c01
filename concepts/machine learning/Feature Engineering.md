Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into [[Feature|features]] that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.

**Why is it important?**
- Raw data is often not in a form that is suitable for machine learning algorithms
- Feature engineering can help expose additional relevant information to the model
- It can significantly improve model performance and predictive power

**When is it needed?**
- For any supervised machine learning task (classification, regression)
- When working with structured or unstructured data
- When dealing with high-dimensional data
