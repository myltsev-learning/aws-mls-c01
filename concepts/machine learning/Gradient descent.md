Gradient descent is an optimization technique widely used in machine learning. It's essentially a step-by-step process to find the ideal values for a function's parameters that minimize its errors. Imagine you're lost in a hilly landscape and trying to get to the lowest valley. Gradient descent helps you navigate by pointing you in the direction that's most downhill at each step.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

- **Cost function:** This function represents the error in your machine learning model's predictions. You want to minimize this error as much as possible.
- **Gradient:** The [[concepts/math/Gradient|gradient]] tells you the direction of steepest descent for the cost function. It's like having an arrow pointing downhill at your current location in the hilly landscape.
- **Iterations:** Gradient descent works iteratively. You start with initial guesses for the function's parameters, then keep adjusting them based on the gradient's direction. This way, you gradually inch closer to the minimum of the cost function.
- **Learning rate:** This value controls the step size you take in each iteration. A larger learning rate means bigger steps, which can lead to faster convergence but also increase the risk of jumping past the ideal minimum.

Here are some additional points to consider:

- Gradient descent typically finds local minima, which are the lowest points in a specific region of the cost function. There might be even lower valleys (global minima) elsewhere, but this method won't necessarily find them.
- It's a fundamental algorithm in machine learning and is used to train various models, including linear regression and neural networks.
