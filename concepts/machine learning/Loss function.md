In machine learning, a l<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">oss function, also sometimes referred to as a cost function or error function, is a method for evaluating how well a machine learning model is performing. It quantifies the difference between the predicted outputs of the model and the actual target values.</mark>

Imagine you're training a machine learning model to predict housing prices. The loss function would tell you how far off your model's predicted prices are from the actual selling prices of the houses in your training data.

The lower the loss, the better the model is performing at predicting the correct value. Loss functions are essential for training machine learning models because they provide a signal that the model can use to adjust its internal parameters and improve its performance over time.

Here's a simple example: imagine you're training a model to predict the following temperatures:

- Day 1: Predicted 70 degrees, Actual 68 degrees (Loss = 2)
- Day 2: Predicted 80 degrees, Actual 77 degrees (Loss = 9)
- Day 3: Predicted 65 degrees, Actual 62 degrees (Loss = 9)

The average loss here would be 6.67. This tells us that the model's predictions are, on average, off by about 6.67 degrees. By minimizing the loss function over the entire training set, the model can learn to improve its accuracy.

There are different loss functions used for different tasks. Some common loss functions include:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE): often used for regression problems
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): another common choice for regression problems
- Binary Cross Entropy: used for binary classification problems
- Categorical Cross Entropy: used for multi-class classification problems

The choice of loss function depends on the specific machine learning task you're trying to solve.
