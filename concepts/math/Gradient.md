In single-variable calculus, the derivative tells you the rate of change of a function at a specific point. In multivariable calculus, when you're dealing with functions that depend on multiple variables (x, y, z, etc.), the concept of a single derivative doesn't quite apply. The **gradient** comes to the rescue!

## Definition

The gradient, denoted by $grad(f)$ or $∇f$ (nabla f), is a vector that captures the rate of change of a multivariable function in all its relevant directions (typically x, y, and z). It essentially tells you:

- **Direction:** The direction in which the function increases most rapidly.
- **Magnitude:** The magnitude of the vector represents the steepness of the increase in that direction.

## Formula

For a function f(x, y, z) (three variables, but the concept extends to higher dimensions as well), the gradient is calculated as follows:

$$
∇f = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z)
$$

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Partial Derivatives:** You take the partial derivative of the function f with respect to each of its variables. Remember, a partial derivative treats all other variables as constants while taking the derivative with respect to one variable.

2. **Vector Formation:** The partial derivatives become the components of a vector. The first element (∂f/∂x) represents the rate of change with respect to x, the second (∂f/∂y) represents the rate of change with respect to y, and so on.

## Interpretation

Imagine a three-dimensional landscape where the height represents the value of your function f(x, y, z). The gradient at any point on this landscape points uphill in the direction of steepest ascent. The magnitude of the gradient vector tells you how steep that climb is.
