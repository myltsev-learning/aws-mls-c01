Variance in math, specifically in statistics, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">refers to a measure of how spread out data points are in a set compared to their average (mean). It quantifies how much each data point deviates from the mean, on average.</mark>

Here's a breakdown:

2. **Calculate differences:** For each data point, find the difference between its value and the mean of the entire set.
4. **Square the differences:** To avoid negative values messing up the calculations, square each difference. Squaring ensures all values are positive.
6. **Average the squared differences:** Add up all the squared differences and divide by the number of data points. This gives you the average squared deviation from the mean, which is the variance.

**Why is variance important?**

- It helps compare the variability of different datasets. A higher variance indicates more spread, a lower variance indicates data points are closer to the mean.
- It's used in various statistical analyses, like hypothesis testing and regression analysis.
- It's directly related to the standard deviation, which is another common measure of spread (square root of variance).

**Remember:**

- Variance is expressed in units squared compared to the original data (e.g., if data is in meters, variance will be in meters squared).
- It's a non-negative value.
- Understanding variance is crucial for interpreting and analyzing data effectively.
