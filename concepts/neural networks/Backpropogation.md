**Backpropagation** is a crucial algorithm used in training deep learning models. It allows the network to **learn and adjust its weights** to minimize the difference between its predictions and the desired outputs. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

**Process:**

1. **Forward pass:** The network receives an input, processes it through the layers of neurons using activation functions, and generates an output prediction.
2. **Loss calculation:** The difference between the predicted output and the actual target value (ground truth) is calculated using a [[concepts/neural networks/Loss Function|Loss Function]]. This loss function quantifies how "wrong" the prediction is.
3. **Error propagation:** The calculated error is then propagated backward through the network, layer by layer. This involves calculating the **gradients** of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network. The gradient essentially indicates how much changing that specific weight would contribute to reducing the overall loss.
4. **Weight update:** Based on the calculated gradients, the weights of the network are adjusted in a way that **reduces the loss**. This is typically done using an optimization algorithm like gradient descent.

**Significance:**

- **Learning from mistakes:** Backpropagation allows the network to learn from its errors by identifying how adjustments to individual weights can collectively improve the overall performance.
- **Iterative optimization:** Through repeated forward passes, loss calculations, and weight updates, the network gradually learns to map input data to the desired outputs with increasing accuracy.

**Analogy:**

Imagine navigating a maze. Backpropagation is like retracing your steps after hitting a dead end, identifying the wrong turns you took (weight adjustments), and making corrections to find the optimal path (minimizing loss).

**Essentially, backpropagation is the engine that drives learning in deep learning models, enabling them to continuously improve their performance by iteratively adjusting their internal parameters.**
