**Deep learning** is a subfield of [[Machine Learning (ML)|machine learning]] that draws inspiration from the structure and function of the human brain. It utilizes **[[Artificial Neural Network (ANN)|artificial neural networks]]** , which are complex algorithms designed to mimic the way biological neurons process information. These networks consist of interconnected layers of [[entities/ml/Artificial Neuron||artificial neurons]] , where each neuron receives input signals from other neurons, applies a mathematical function called an [[entities/ml/Activation Function|Activation Function]] , and outputs a signal to the next layer.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of deep learning:

- **Inspiration from the brain:** Deep learning models are inspired by the hierarchical structure of the brain, where information is processed through multiple layers of interconnected neurons.
- **Artificial neural networks:** These networks are the building blocks of deep learning, mimicking the functionality of biological neurons. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information and learn from data.
- **Learning process:** Deep learning models learn by adjusting the **weights** of the connections between neurons. These weights determine the strength of the signal transmitted between neurons and are iteratively adjusted through an algorithm called **backpropagation** to minimize the difference between the network's predictions and the desired outputs.
- **Complex patterns:** Deep learning models excel at identifying and extracting complex patterns from large amounts of data, making them particularly well-suited for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
