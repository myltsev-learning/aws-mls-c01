**Softmax** is a specific type of activation function commonly used in the **output layer** of deep learning models, particularly for **multi-class classification** problems. Here's how it works:

**Functionality:**

- **Input:** Softmax takes a vector of real numbers as input, typically representing the outputs from the previous layer in the network.
- **Output:** It transforms the input vector into a **probability distribution** across all possible classes. Each element in the output vector represents the probability of the input belonging to a specific class.
- **Formula:** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The mathematical formula for softmax involves applying the exponential function to each element in the input vector and then normalizing the resulting values to sum up to 1.</mark>

**Significance:**

- **Probability interpretation:** Softmax allows the network to interpret its output as probabilities for each class, making it suitable for tasks where the model needs to predict the most likely class among multiple options.
- **Multi-class classification:** In multi-class classification problems where the model needs to choose one class out of several possibilities, softmax provides a principled way to represent the network's confidence in each class.

**Example:**

Imagine a network classifying images of handwritten digits. The output layer might have 10 neurons, one for each digit (0-9). After applying softmax, the output would be a vector of 10 probabilities, representing the likelihood of the image belonging to each digit class.

**In essence, softmax serves as a crucial component in multi-class classification tasks, enabling the network to express its predictions as probabilities for each potential class.**
