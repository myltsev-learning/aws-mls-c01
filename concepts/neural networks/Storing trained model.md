After learning, when the [[concepts/neural networks/Weight|weights]] of the connections in a deep learning model have been adjusted to minimize the [[concepts/neural networks/Loss Function|Loss Function]], the model needs to be stored for future use. This process involves saving the **model parameters**, which essentially capture the **learned knowledge** of the network. Here's what happens:

**Model Parameters:**

- The model parameters primarily consist of the **weights** and **biases** associated with each neuron in the network. These values represent the **strengths of the connections** and **offsets** applied within the network, which have been optimized during training to perform the desired task.
- Additionally, some models might also store information about the **network architecture**, including the number of layers, neuron types, and activation functions used. This information defines the overall structure of the network.

**Saving Methods:**

There are various methods for saving deep learning models, depending on the specific framework or library used:

- **Serialization:** This involves converting the model parameters and optionally the network architecture into a **serialized format** like JSON or pickle. This format can then be stored as a file on disk or transmitted over a network.
- **Model checkpoints:** During training, the model parameters can be saved at regular intervals or at specific milestones like achieving a certain performance metric. This allows recovering the model state if training is interrupted or for rollbacks if the performance degrades.
- **Framework-specific formats:** Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch often have their own specific formats for storing models, which are optimized for efficient loading and deployment.

**Importance of Saving Models:**

- **Reusability:** Saved models can be reused for various purposes, such as making predictions on new data, deploying the model in a production environment, or fine-tuning the model for different tasks.
- **Reproducibility:** Saving the model parameters allows reproducing the model's behavior even if the original training environment is no longer available.
- **Sharing:** Models can be shared with others for collaboration, research, or deployment in various applications.

**In essence, saving a deep learning model after learning essentially captures the acquired knowledge and enables its utilization for various purposes beyond the initial training phase.**

Example:

```JSON
{
  "layers": [
    {
      "type": "Dense",
      "units": 10,
      "activation": "relu",
      "weights": [
        [
          [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
          [0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
          [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
        ],
        [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
      ],
      "biases": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Explanation:**

- This example represents a simple **feedforward network** with one **dense layer** containing 10 neurons and using the ReLU activation function.
- The `layers` key stores information about each layer in the network.
- Within the layer dictionary, `weights` and `biases` represent the key parameters learned during training.
- `weights` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents the weights connecting the previous layer's neurons to the current neuron.
- `biases` is a list containing the bias values for each neuron in the layer.

**Important Note:**

This is a simplified example for illustrative purposes. Real-world deep learning models can have much more complex architectures with numerous layers, different neuron types, and additional parameters beyond weights and biases. The specific format for storing models also varies depending on the deep learning framework used.
