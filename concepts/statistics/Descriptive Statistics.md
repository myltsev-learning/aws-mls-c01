Descriptive statistics are tools used to condense and organize a collection of data into a more understandable format. Imagine you have a giant bag of candy, and you want to know what kind of candy is in there, and how much of each kind. Descriptive statistics are like taking an inventory of the candy: sorting them by type, counting how many of each there are, and maybe even checking the weight of some samples.

Here are some key points about descriptive statistics:

- **Summarizes data:** It provides a summary of the important characteristics of a dataset. This can include things like the average value ([[concepts/statistics/Mean|mean]]), the most frequent value ([[concepts/statistics/Mode|mode]]), and how spread out the data is ([[concepts/math/Variance|variance]]).
- **Doesn't draw conclusions:** Unlike inferential statistics, descriptive statistics don't allow you to draw conclusions about a larger population from which your data might be a sample. They just focus on the data you have in front of you.
- **Uses various methods:** There are different ways to do descriptive statistics, including using numbers (like calculating the mean) or using visuals (like charts and graphs). These methods all serve to give you a clearer picture of what the data looks like.

By using descriptive statistics, you can get a good sense of what's going on in your data. This can be helpful for a variety of tasks, such as identifying patterns, spotting trends, and making comparisons.
