The **mean** in statistics, often called the **arithmetic mean**, represents the **average** of a set of data. It's a single number that summarizes the overall value or tendency of the data. There are actually different types of means in statistics, but when people say "mean", they generally refer to the **arithmetic mean**.

Here are some key things to know about the mean:

- **Calculation:** The mean is calculated by<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> **summing all the values in the dataset and then dividing by the total number of values**</mark>. For example, if you have a set of data points {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, the mean would be (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 6.
- **Interpretation:** The mean represents a **balance point** for the data, where most values tend to fall. However, it's important to remember that it can be influenced by extreme values (outliers) in the data.
- **Comparison to other measures:** The mean is one of three main measures of **central tendency**, along with the **median** and the **mode**. The median is the "middle" value when the data is ordered, while the mode is the most frequent value. Depending on the distribution of the data, these measures can all give different insights.
