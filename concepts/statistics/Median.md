<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The **median** is the **middle value** in a set of data when it's arranged in ascending order (from smallest to largest).</mark>

It essentially divides the data into two halves, with 50% of the values being lower than the median and 50% being higher.

- **For even number of elements:** The median is the **mean** of the two middle elements when the data is arranged in ascending (or descending) order.
- **For odd number of elements:** The median is the **middle element** itself when the data is arranged in ascending (or descending) order.
