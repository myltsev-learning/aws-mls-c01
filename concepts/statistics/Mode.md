<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The mode in statistics is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.</mark> Basically, it's the number you see popping up the most.

Here are some key points about the mode:

- **Not unique:** Unlike the mean (average) and median (middle value), a dataset can have **multiple modes**, **one mode**, or **no mode at all**.
- **Not always representative:** The mode doesn't necessarily represent the "typical" value in the data, especially if the data is skewed or has multiple peaks.
- **Use with caution:** While the mode can be useful for identifying common values, it's important to consider other measures of central tendency (like mean and median) for a more complete picture of the data distribution.
