A "normal distribution," also known as a Gaussian distribution, is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a specific way that data can be spread out</mark>. It has several key characteristics:

**Shape:** It resembles a bell curve, with most data points clustered around the [[concepts/statistics/Mean|mean]] (average) and fewer and fewer data points as you move farther away from the mean.

**Symmetry:** The curve is symmetrical around the mean, meaning there are equal chances of a data point being above or below the mean by a certain distance.

**Measures of central tendency:** In a perfectly normal distribution, the [[concepts/statistics/Mean|mean]], [[concepts/statistics/Median|median]], and [[concepts/statistics/Mode|mode]] are all exactly the same.

**Standard deviation:** The "spread" of the data is determined by the **standard deviation**. A wider standard deviation means the data is more spread out, while a narrower standard deviation means the data is more concentrated around the mean.

Here are some additional points to remember:

- **Not all data is normally distributed:** While the normal distribution is incredibly useful and used in many fields, it's important to remember that not all data sets will follow this pattern. Some data may be skewed (leaning towards one side) or have multiple peaks.
- **Assessing normality:** There are various ways to check if your data is normally distributed, such as visually inspecting a histogram or using statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test.
- **Importance:** The normal distribution has many applications in statistics, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Understanding its properties is crucial for various statistical analyses.
