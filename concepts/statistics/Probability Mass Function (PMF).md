A probability mass function (PMF) is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a function that describes the probability of each possible outcome for a **discrete** random variable</mark>. It assigns a probability value between 0 and 1 to each possible value that the variable can take on.

Here are the key characteristics of a PMF:

- **Applies to discrete variables:** It is used for variables that can only take on a finite or countable number of distinct values, like the number of heads in 3 coin flips (0, 1, 2, or 3) or the number of customers arriving in a store in an hour (0, 1, 2, ...).
- **Assigns probabilities:** For each possible value of the variable, the PMF gives the probability that the variable will actually be equal to that value. These probabilities must always be non-negative (0 or greater) and their sum must equal 1, since one of the possible values must occur.
- **Visual representation:** The PMF can be visualized as a bar chart where the height of each bar represents the probability of the corresponding value.

PMFs are essential tools in probability and statistics for analyzing discrete random events. They allow us to calculate the probability of specific outcomes, compare the likelihood of different events, and even predict future outcomes based on the known probability distribution.

Here are some real-world examples of where PMFs are used:

- **Predicting the number of customers in a store:** A retail store owner might use a PMF to estimate the probability of having a certain number of customers on a given day, helping them with inventory management and staffing.
- **Analyzing the results of a dice roll:** The PMF for the number of spots showing on a rolled die is a classic example, with each value (1, 2, ..., 6) having an equal probability of 1/6.
- **Modeling the spread of a disease:** Public health experts might use PMFs to model the probability of an individual being infected by a disease, depending on factors like vaccination rates and contact patterns.
