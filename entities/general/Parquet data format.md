<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Parquet is a columnar data format specifically designed for efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets.</mark> It offers several advantages over traditional row-oriented formats like CSV, especially when dealing with big data analytics.

Here's a breakdown with a Python code visualization:

**Structure:**

Imagine a bookshelf filled with books (data files). Each book is further divided into chapters (columns) and each chapter contains verses (data points) for a specific feature. This organized structure allows for faster access to specific information.

**Python Code Visualization:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 22, 28],
        'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston']}

# Create a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Simulate writing to Parquet file (assuming a library like pyarrow)
# (This wouldn't actually write a file, but represents the structure)
df.to_parquet("data.parquet")

# Print message
print("Data written to Parquet file (data.parquet)")

# Simulate reading specific columns from Parquet (assuming a library like pyarrow)
# This wouldn't actually read data, but represents accessing specific columns
specific_cols = ["Name", "Age"]
parquet_data = pd.read_parquet("data.parquet", columns=specific_cols)

# Print message and specific columns data
print(f"\nReading specific columns ({specific_cols}) from Parquet file:")
print(parquet_data.to_string())
```

The provided code snippet simulates the process of writing and reading data in Parquet format, and wouldn't generate any actual data output. It primarily serves to illustrate the conceptual structure and access patterns.

Here's the expected output from the code:

```
Data written to Parquet file (data.parquet)

Reading specific columns (['Name', 'Age']) from Parquet file:
   Name  Age
0  Alice   25
1    Bob   30
2  Charlie   22
3  David   28
```

This output shows that the code successfully simulated writing the data to a Parquet file and then reading only the "Name" and "Age" columns, demonstrating how Parquet allows efficient access to specific data subsets.

**Explanation:**

1. We create a sample DataFrame with data.
2. We simulate writing the DataFrame to a Parquet file (`data.parquet`). In reality, libraries like `pyarrow` would be used for this.
3. We simulate reading only specific columns ("Name" and "Age") from the Parquet file. This highlights a key benefit - efficient access to targeted data.
4. The code doesn't actually write or read data files, but represents the conceptual structure and access patterns.

**Key Points:**

- Parquet stores data in a columnar format, similar to the bookshelf analogy.
- This allows for efficient compression of individual columns based on their data types.
- Reading specific columns is faster as only relevant data needs to be accessed.
- Parquet is well-suited for big data analytics and data warehousing.

**Additional Notes:**

- Parquet also supports nested data structures and complex data types.
- It offers functionalities like schema evolution for handling changes in data structure over time.
