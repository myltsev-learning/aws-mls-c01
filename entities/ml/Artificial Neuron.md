An **artificial neuron** is the fundamental unit of computation in a deep learning neural network. It is inspired by the biological neurons found in the human brain and serves as a simple processing unit within the network. Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics:

- **Inputs:** An artificial neuron receives input signals from other neurons in the network. These inputs can be numerical values representing various features or data points.
- **Activation function:** The neuron applies a mathematical function called an **activation function** to its weighted sum of inputs. This function determines how the neuron transforms the received information into an output signal.
- **Output:** The output of the neuron is a single numerical value, which is then passed on to other neurons in the network.

**Essentially, an artificial neuron acts as a simple computational unit that performs a weighted sum of its inputs and applies a non-linear transformation through the activation function.** This allows the network to learn complex relationships between input data and desired outputs.
