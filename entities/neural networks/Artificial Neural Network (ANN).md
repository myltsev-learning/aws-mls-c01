Neural networks, also known as **artificial neural networks (ANNs)**, are a type of [[Machine Learning (ML)]] technology inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are essentially complex algorithms that mimic the way biological neurons connect and transmit signals.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

**Structure:**

- **Neurons:** These are the building blocks of a neural network, similar to neurons in the brain. Each neuron receives inputs, performs calculations based on those inputs, and sends an output signal to other neurons.
- **Layers:** Neurons are organized into layers. Typically, there is an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Information flows from the input layer to the hidden layers and finally to the output layer.
- **Connections:** Neurons are connected to each other through weighted connections. These weights determine how much influence one neuron has on another.

**Function:**

- **Learning:** Neural networks learn by adjusting the weights of their connections based on the data they are trained on. This allows them to improve their ability to perform specific tasks.
- **Types of learning:** There are various learning algorithms used by neural networks, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
- **Applications:** Neural networks are used in a wide range of applications, including:
    
    - **Image recognition:** Identifying objects and people in images.
    - **Natural language processing:** Understanding and generating human language.
    - **Speech recognition:** Converting spoken words into text.
    - **Machine translation:** Translating text from one language to another.
    - **Predictive modeling:** Predicting future events based on past data.

Here are some additional points to consider:

- **Deep learning:** Neural networks with multiple hidden layers are called deep learning networks. These are particularly powerful and have achieved significant breakthroughs in various fields.
- **Black box:** While neural networks are highly effective, their internal workings can be complex and difficult to understand. This is sometimes referred to as the "black box" problem.
- **Continuous development:** Neural network research is an active field, and new architectures and learning algorithms are constantly being developed.
