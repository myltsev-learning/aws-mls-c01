A **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** is a type of [[concepts/neural networks/Deep Learning|Deep Learning]] architecture specifically designed to handle **sequential data** like text, speech, or time series data. Unlike traditional feedforward networks where information flows in one direction, RNNs incorporate **internal memory** to process sequential information by considering not only the current input but also the context of previous elements in the sequence.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Recurring connections:** Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs have connections that loop back to themselves, allowing them to store information about past inputs and utilize it when processing the current input. This "memory" enables them to understand the context of sequential data.
- **Sequential processing:** RNNs process data **one element at a time**, taking into account the previous elements in the sequence to make predictions about the current element. This capability makes them well-suited for tasks like language translation, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.

**Types of RNNs:**

- **Vanilla RNNs:** The simplest form of RNNs, but they can suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients, limiting their ability to learn long-term dependencies.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** A more complex RNN architecture with additional mechanisms to address the vanishing gradient problem, allowing them to learn long-term dependencies effectively.
- **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU):** Another variant of RNNs that addresses the vanishing gradient problem with a simpler gating mechanism compared to LSTMs.

**Applications:**

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Machine translation, sentiment analysis, text generation, and chatbot development.
- **Speech recognition:** Converting spoken language into text.
- **Time series forecasting:** Predicting future values based on historical data, such as stock prices or weather patterns.

**In essence, RNNs are powerful tools for processing and understanding sequential data, making them crucial for various applications in areas like language, speech, and time series analysis.**
