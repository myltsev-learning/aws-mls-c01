> Data distribution means how the [[Types of data|data]] is spread out or clustered around certain values or ranges.


### Normal distribution

<aside>Normal distribution, Guassian distribution</aside>

In statistics, a [[concepts/statistics/Normal Distribution|normal distribution]] or Gaussian distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. The general form of its probability density function is The parameter is the mean or expectation of the distribution, while the parameter is its standard deviation.


### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

<aside>Probability Mass Function (PMF)</aside>

[[Probability Mass Function (PMF)]] is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a function that describes the probability of each possible outcome for a **discrete** random variable</mark>. It assigns a probability value between 0 and 1 to each possible value that the variable can take on.

**It's basically a way how we can visualize the probability of discreet data occurring.** 


### [[concepts/statistics/Poisson Distribution]]

<aside>Poisson Distribution</aside>

A discrete probability distribution that predicts the likelihood of a certain number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given that the events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event.
