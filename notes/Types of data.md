Type of the data affects how we store it, process and which techniques we use to use this data in ML. There are few major types of Data:

1. Numerical
2. Categorical
3. Ordinal

The type of data will dictate what kind of machine learning algorithm we will use for learning.


### Numerical

<aside>Numerical</aside>
Represents some sort of quantitative measurement (heights of people, page load time, prices, etc,)
It's probably the most common data type.

Can be either:
- *Discrete* (integer, discrete values like how many purchases)
- *Continuous* (how much time did it take for a user to check out?)


### Categorical

<aside>Categorical</aside>
Qualitative data that has no inherent mathematical meaning (gender, yes/no data, race, product category, etc.). We can assign numbers to categories, but the numbers will not have mathematical meaning.

### Ordinal

<aside>Ordinal</aside>
It's a mixture of numerical and categorical. Kind of categorical data that has mathematical meaning (rating 1-5)

# Summary

<summary>Write a concise summary here</summary>
There are 3 major data types in context of ML: numerical, categorical and ordinal. Some data has mathematical meaning (numerical and ordinal), some not (categories of the product, states, etc.). The type of the data dictates how we can analyze it and which ML algorithm we should choose for this particular type of the data we have.
