A monitoring service generates 1 TB of scale metrics record data every minute. A Research team performs queries on this data using Amazon Athena. The queries run slowly due to the large volume of data, and the team requires better performance.  
How should the records be stored in Amazon S3 to improve query performance?  

A.¬†CSV files
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">B.¬†Parquet files</mark>
C.¬†Compressed JSON
D.¬†RecordIO

My answer: B

## Correct Answer üëè

Your answer (B. Parquet files) is correct. üéâ

## Explanation

1. **A. CSV files**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are a common format for storing tabular data, but they are not optimized for large-scale data analytics. CSV files are text-based and do not provide efficient compression or columnar storage, which can lead to slower query performance when dealing with large volumes of data.
    
2. **B. Parquet files**: Parquet is a columnar storage format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval in big data workloads. It provides efficient compression, columnar storage, and supports complex nested data structures. Parquet files are optimized for querying large datasets, making them an excellent choice for storing and querying the 1 TB of scale metrics record data in this scenario.
    
3. **C. Compressed JSON**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely-used data format for storing and transmitting structured data. While compressing JSON files can reduce storage requirements, JSON is not optimized for large-scale data analytics like Parquet. JSON files are typically less efficient for querying large datasets due to their row-based storage format and lack of advanced compression techniques.
    
4. **D. RecordIO**: RecordIO is a file format used by Apache Hadoop for storing binary data. It is primarily used for storing intermediate data during MapReduce jobs and is not commonly used for storing and querying large datasets in data analytics workloads.
    
Since the research team requires better query performance on the 1 TB of scale metrics record data, storing the data in the columnar Parquet format is the best choice among the given options. Parquet's efficient compression, columnar storage, and optimizations for large-scale data analytics make it well-suited for this use case.
