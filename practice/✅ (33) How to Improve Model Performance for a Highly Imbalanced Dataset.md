A gaming company has launched an online game where people can start playing for free, but they need to pay if they choose to use certain features. The company needs to build an automated system to predict whether or not a new user will become a paid user within 1 year. The company has gathered a labeled dataset from 1 million users.  
The training dataset consists of 1,000 positive samples (from users who ended up paying within 1 year) and 999,000 negative samples (from users who did not use any paid features). Each data sample consists of 200 features including user age, device, location, and play patterns.  
Using this dataset for training, the Data Science team trained a random forest model that converged with over 99% accuracy on the training set. However, the prediction results on a test dataset were not satisfactory  
Which of the following approaches should the Data Science team take to mitigate this issue? (Choose two.)  

A. Add more deep trees to the random forest to enable the model to learn more features.
B. Include a copy of the samples in the test dataset in the training dataset.
C. Generate more positive samples by duplicating the positive samples and adding a small amount of noise to the duplicated data.
D. Change the cost function so that false negatives have a higher impact on the cost value than false positives.
E. Change the cost function so that false positives have a higher impact on the cost value than false negatives.

My answer: C, D

Your answer is absolutely correct! Here's a breakdown of why C and D are the best approaches, and why the others aren't as effective:

**Why C and D are the best approaches:**

- **C. Generate more positive samples by duplicating the positive samples and adding a small amount of noise to the duplicated data.** This addresses the class imbalance issue. Since the dataset is severely skewed towards negative samples, your model will easily achieve high accuracy by simply predicting 'not a paid user' for all instances. Creating more positive examples (even with slight variations) helps the model better learn the characteristics of what it means to become a paid user.
    
- **D. Change the cost function so that false negatives have a higher impact on the cost value than false positives.** This aligns with the business objective. Since the goal is to predict paid users, a false negative (missing a potential paid user) is arguably worse for the company than a false positive (mistakenly identifying a non-paying user as likely to pay). A modified cost function forces the model to prioritize reducing those costly false negatives.
    

**Why the other options are less ideal:**

- **A. Add more deep trees to the random forest to enable the model to learn more features.** While more trees can sometimes improve model performance, it's unlikely to be the core solution here. The class imbalance and cost function issues are more likely the root of the poor results.
    
- **B. Include a copy of the samples in the test dataset in the training dataset.** This is a big 'no-no' in machine learning. It leads to data leakage, inflating evaluation metrics and not giving a true picture of real-world performance.
    
- **E. Change the cost function so that false positives have a higher impact on the cost value than false negatives.** This goes against the business goal. While false positives do have a cost, focusing on them would increase the number of potential paid users you miss out on.


**Additional Considerations:**

- **Sampling Techniques:** You could use undersampling (reducing majority class samples) or oversampling (like option C, but with more sophisticated techniques like SMOTE) to address the class imbalance.
- **Metrics:** Instead of just accuracy, consider precision, recall, and F1 scores that are better suited for imbalanced datasets.
