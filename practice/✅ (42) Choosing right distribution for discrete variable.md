A Machine Learning Specialist is implementing a full Bayesian network on a dataset that describes public transit in New York City. One of the random variables is discrete, and represents the number of minutes New Yorkers wait for a bus given that the buses cycle every 10 minutes, with a mean of 3 minutes.  
Which prior probability distribution should the ML Specialist use for this variable?  

A. Poisson distribution
B. Uniform distribution
C. Normal distribution
D. Binomial distribution

My answer: A

Absolutely, here's a chain-of-thought explanation for why the Poisson distribution (A) is the most suitable choice in this scenario:

**Understanding the Scenario**

- **Discrete Variable:** We're dealing with waiting time in minutes, which is a whole number (0, 1, 2, ...) making it a discrete variable.
- **Time-based Events:** The situation involves counting events (bus arrivals) within a fixed time interval (10-minute bus cycle).
- **Average Rate:** We know the average waiting time is 3 minutes.

**Matching Distribution Characteristics**

- **Poisson Distribution:**
    - Models the number of events occurring within a fixed time interval.
    - Well-suited for situations where we have an average rate of occurrence (3 minutes average wait in our case).
    - Handles discrete values (perfect for our waiting time in minutes).

**Why Other Options Are Less Ideal**

- **Uniform Distribution:** Assumes all values within a range are equally likely. This is unlikely for bus waiting times, where waiting closer to the average is more probable than extremes.
- **Normal Distribution:** Primarily for continuous variables and typically assumes a symmetrical distribution. Bus waiting times likely skew towards shorter waits.
- **Binomial Distribution:** Models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials. Doesn't fit the continuous nature of waiting time.
