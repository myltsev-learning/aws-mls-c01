A Machine Learning Specialist has created a deep learning neural network model that performs well on the training data but performs poorly on the test data.  
Which of the following methods should the Specialist consider using to correct this? (Choose three.)  

A. Decrease regularization.
B. Increase regularization.
C. Increase dropout.
D. Decrease dropout.
E. Increase feature combinations.
F. Decrease feature combinations.

My answer: B, C, F

You're on the right track! Here's a breakdown of why B, C, and F are the best choices, and why the others are less likely to help in this scenario:

**Correct Answers:**

- **B. Increase regularization:** Your model is likely overfitting the training data (performing well on what it's seen, but not generalizing to new data). Regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization help prevent overfitting by penalizing overly complex models.
- **C. Increase dropout:** Dropout is another regularization technique that works by randomly dropping out neurons during training. This helps reduce overfitting by preventing the model from relying too heavily on specific patterns in the training data.
- **F. Decrease feature combinations:** If you have a large number of feature combinations, this can increase model complexity and the potential for overfitting. Reducing feature combinations can simplify your model.

**Why Other Options Are Less Ideal:**

- **A. Decrease regularization:** Decreasing regularization would likely worsen the overfitting problem, not address it.
- **D. Decrease dropout:** Decreasing dropout would make the model more prone to overfitting.
- **E. Increase feature combinations:** Increasing feature combinations would generally increase model complexity and could worsen overfitting.

**Key Points to Consider:**

- **Overfitting vs. Underfitting:** The problem described is a classic case of overfitting. Be sure to distinguish it from underfitting (where the model performs poorly on both training and test data).
- **Experimentation:** The best solutions often involve a combination of techniques. Experiment to find what works most effectively for your specific dataset and model.
