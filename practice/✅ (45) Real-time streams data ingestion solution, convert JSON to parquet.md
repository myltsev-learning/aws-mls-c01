A Data Scientist needs to create a serverless ingestion and analytics solution for high-velocity, real-time streaming data.  
The ingestion process must buffer and convert incoming records from JSON to a query-optimized, columnar format without data loss. The output datastore must be highly available, and Analysts must be able to run SQL queries against the data and connect to existing business intelligence dashboards.  
Which solution should the Data Scientist build to satisfy the requirements?  

A. Create a schema in the AWS Glue Data Catalog of the incoming data format. Use an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to stream the data and transform the data to Apache Parquet or ORC format using the AWS Glue Data Catalog before delivering to Amazon S3. Have the Analysts query the data directly from Amazon S3 using Amazon Athena, and connect to BI tools using the Athena Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) connector.

B. Write each JSON record to a staging location in Amazon S3. Use the S3 Put event to trigger an AWS Lambda function that transforms the data into Apache Parquet or ORC format and writes the data to a processed data location in Amazon S3. Have the Analysts query the data directly from Amazon S3 using Amazon Athena, and connect to BI tools using the Athena Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) connector.

C. Write each JSON record to a staging location in Amazon S3. Use the S3 Put event to trigger an AWS Lambda function that transforms the data into Apache Parquet or ORC format and inserts it into an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database. Have the Analysts query and run dashboards from the RDS database.

D. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to ingest the streaming data and perform real-time SQL queries to convert the records to Apache Parquet before delivering to Amazon S3. Have the Analysts query the data directly from Amazon S3 using Amazon Athena and connect to BI tools using the Athena Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) connector.

My answer: A

Yes, option A is the most suitable solution for this scenario. Here's a breakdown of why it's the best choice and considerations for the other options:

**A. Create a schema in the AWS Glue Data Catalog of the incoming data format. Use an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to stream the data and transform the data to Apache Parquet or ORC format using the AWS Glue Data Catalog before delivering to Amazon S3. Have the Analysts query the data directly from Amazon S3 using Amazon Athena, and connect to BI tools using the Athena Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) connector.**

- **Serverless:** All components (AWS Glue, Kinesis Data Firehose, S3, Athena) are serverless, aligning with the requirement.
- **Columnar Format:** Parquet or ORC provide efficient querying and storage optimization.
- **Data Catalog:** AWS Glue Data Catalog simplifies data organization and schema management.
- **Reliability:** Kinesis Data Firehose provides a robust and scalable data ingestion mechanism.
- **Analyst Workflow:** Athena offers SQL-based querying, and the JDBC connector enables integration with BI dashboards.

**Let's analyze why the other options are less ideal:**

- **B. Write each JSON record to a staging location in Amazon S3. Use the S3 Put event to trigger an AWS Lambda function...**
    
    - While functional, managing individual Lambda invocations for each JSON record might introduce overhead and potential delays compared to Kinesis Data Firehose's continuous processing.
- **C. Write each JSON record to a staging location in Amazon S3. Use the S3 Put event to trigger an AWS Lambda function... inserts it into an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database.**
    
    - Introducing Amazon RDS adds the burden of managing a database instance, potentially deviating from the serverless requirement. Also, continuously writing small records to RDS might not be the most efficient use of a relational database.
- **D. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to ingest the streaming data...**
    
    - While Kinesis Data Analytics is excellent for real-time analytics, the requirement emphasizes storing data in a columnar format for querying, which Kinesis Data Analytics may not directly handle.

**Key Points:**

- The best solution often leverages the strengths of individual AWS services, working in tandem.
- Consider scalability, ease of management, and alignment with analyst workflows when choosing a solution.
