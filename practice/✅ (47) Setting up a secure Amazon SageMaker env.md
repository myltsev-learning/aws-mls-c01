A company is setting up an Amazon SageMaker environment. The corporate data security policy does not allow communication over the internet.  
How can the company enable the Amazon SageMaker service without enabling direct internet access to Amazon SageMaker notebook instances?  

A.Â Create a NAT gateway within the corporate VPC.
B.Â Route Amazon SageMaker traffic through an on-premises network.
C.Â Create Amazon SageMaker VPC interface endpoints within the corporate VPC.
D.Â Create VPC peering with Amazon VPC hosting Amazon SageMaker.

My answer: C

## Correct Answer

You have selected the correct answer: **C. Create Amazon SageMaker VPC interface endpoints within the corporate VPC.**

Well done! ðŸŽ‰ This is the right approach to enable the Amazon SageMaker service without allowing direct internet access to the notebook instances.

## Explanation

Amazon SageMaker VPC interface endpoints allow you to connect to the SageMaker service from within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using private IP addresses, without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection. This ensures that all traffic between your VPC and the SageMaker service remains within the AWS network, providing a secure and private communication channel.

By creating VPC interface endpoints for SageMaker within your corporate VPC, you can access the service without exposing your resources to the internet, thus adhering to your corporate data security policy.

The other options provided in the question are either incorrect or incomplete solutions:

- **A. Create a NAT gateway within the corporate VPC:** While a NAT gateway would allow instances in your VPC to access the internet, it does not provide a secure and private connection to the SageMaker service specifically.
- **B. Route Amazon SageMaker traffic through an on-premises network:** This option is not feasible as it would require establishing a direct connection between your on-premises network and the SageMaker service, which is not possible without exposing your resources to the internet.
- **D. Create VPC peering with Amazon VPC hosting Amazon SageMaker:** VPC peering allows you to route traffic between two VPCs, but it does not provide a secure and private connection to the SageMaker service itself.
