A financial services company is building a robust serverless data lake on Amazon S3. The data lake should be flexible and meet the following requirements:  
✑ Support querying old and new data on Amazon S3 through Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.  
✑ Support event-driven ETL pipelines  
✑ Provide a quick and easy way to understand metadata  
Which approach meets these requirements?  

A. Use an AWS Glue crawler to crawl S3 data, an AWS Lambda function to trigger an AWS Glue ETL job, and an AWS Glue Data catalog to search and discover metadata.
B. Use an AWS Glue crawler to crawl S3 data, an AWS Lambda function to trigger an AWS Batch job, and an external Apache Hive metastore to search and discover metadata.
C. Use an AWS Glue crawler to crawl S3 data, an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to trigger an AWS Batch job, and an AWS Glue Data Catalog to search and discover metadata.
D. Use an AWS Glue crawler to crawl S3 data, an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to trigger an AWS Glue ETL job, and an external Apache Hive metastore to search and discover metadata.

My answer: A

Absolutely! Option A is the most suitable choice to build a robust and efficient serverless data lake on Amazon S3. Here's why:

**A. Use an AWS Glue crawler to crawl S3 data, an AWS Lambda function to trigger an AWS Glue ETL job, and an AWS Glue Data catalog to search and discover metadata.**

- **Serverless Components:** Aligns with the requirements by utilizing fully managed AWS services (AWS Glue, Lambda).
- **Automatic Metadata Management:** AWS Glue crawlers automatically infer schema and populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog, providing a centralized metadata repository.
- **Streamlined Event-Driven ETL:** Lambda functions efficiently handle event-driven triggers, launching ETL jobs to transform and process data as needed.
- **Querying Flexibility:** Athena and Redshift Spectrum can seamlessly query data directly in S3, using the metadata from the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

**Why other options are less ideal:**

- **B. ... an external Apache Hive metastore ...** Introducing an external Hive metastore adds unnecessary management overhead in a serverless context. AWS Glue Data Catalog is the natural choice within the AWS ecosystem.
- **C. ... an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to trigger an AWS Batch job ...** CloudWatch alarms are suitable for time-based scheduling. However, Lambda functions provide more flexibility for event-driven ETL triggering.
- **D. ... an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to trigger an AWS Glue ETL job, and an external Apache Hive metastore ...** Combines the drawbacks of both options B and C.

**Key Points**

- The combination of AWS Glue, Lambda, and S3 creates a powerful, scalable, and cost-effective serverless data lake solution.
