A Machine Learning Specialist needs to be able to ingest streaming data and store it in Apache Parquet files for exploration and analysis.  
Which of the following services would both ingest and store this data in the correct format?  

A. AWS DMS
B. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
C. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
D. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics

My answer: C

---

Absolutely! You're correct. Let's discuss why C (Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose) is the best fit for this scenario:

**C. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**

- **Streaming Ingestion:** Kinesis Firehose is designed for continuous, real-time ingestion of streaming data.
- **Parquet Support:** It has built-in capabilities to convert data into Parquet format (or ORC) for efficient storage and analysis.
- **Direct Delivery to S3:** Kinesis Firehose can directly store the transformed data in Parquet files within S3, ready for querying.
- **Serverless and Scalable:** Kinesis Firehose handles the provisioning and scaling of resources for you.

**Why other options are less suitable:**

- **A. AWS DMS:** Primarily used for database migration, not real-time streaming ingestion. It might not be as efficient for continuous data flows.
- **B. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams:** While excellent for streaming data, it doesn't natively handle format conversion or data persistence to S3. You'd need additional components for that (Lambda + S3).
- **D. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics:** This service focuses on real-time analytics and SQL-based transformations on streaming data, not persistent storage in Parquet.
