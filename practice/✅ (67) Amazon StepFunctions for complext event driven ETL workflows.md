A Machine Learning Specialist is developing a daily ETL workflow containing multiple ETL jobs. The workflow consists of the following processes:  
* Start the workflow as soon as data is uploaded to Amazon S3.  
* When all the datasets are available in Amazon S3, start an ETL job to join the uploaded datasets with multiple terabyte-sized datasets already stored in Amazon  
S3.  
* Store the results of joining datasets in Amazon S3.  
* If one of the jobs fails, send a notification to the Administrator.  
Which configuration will meet these requirements?  

A. Use AWS Lambda to trigger an AWS Step Functions workflow to wait for dataset uploads to complete in Amazon S3. Use AWS Glue to join the datasets. Use an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to send an SNS notification to the Administrator in the case of a failure.

B. Develop the ETL workflow using AWS Lambda to start an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. Use a lifecycle configuration script to join the datasets and persist the results in Amazon S3. Use an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to send an SNS notification to the Administrator in the case of a failure.

C. Develop the ETL workflow using AWS Batch to trigger the start of ETL jobs when data is uploaded to Amazon S3. Use AWS Glue to join the datasets in Amazon S3. Use an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to send an SNS notification to the Administrator in the case of a failure.

D. Use AWS Lambda to chain other Lambda functions to read and join the datasets in Amazon S3 as soon as the data is uploaded to Amazon S3. Use an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to send an SNS notification to the Administrator in the case of a failure.

My answer: A

You're spot on! Option A is the configuration that best aligns with the given requirements. Let's break down why it's superior to the other choices:

**Why A is the best choice:**

- **Workflow Orchestration:** AWS Step Functions is ideal for orchestrating complex workflows with dependencies and error handling, fitting the scenario perfectly.
- **Scalable ETL:** AWS Glue is well-suited for large-scale ETL jobs, especially when joining multiple terabyte-sized datasets.
- **Monitoring and Notifications:** Amazon CloudWatch alarms and SNS notifications provide a robust mechanism for failure monitoring and alerting the Administrator.
- **Triggering:** The ability to trigger the workflow from an S3 upload event ensures the process starts immediately when new data is available.

**Why other options are less ideal:**

- **B. Amazon SageMaker Notebook:** While SageMaker notebooks can be used for ETL, they are often best suited for interactive development and experimentation rather than production workflows. Lifecycle configurations add complexity without direct benefit to this scenario.
- **C. AWS Batch:** AWS Batch is designed for batch computing jobs. It's less optimized for the dynamic, event-driven workflow described in the requirements.
- **D. Chained AWS Lambda Functions:** While Lambda can be used for ETL, chaining them for large datasets might lead to scalability, timeout, and management challenges. Glue is better designed for such workloads.
