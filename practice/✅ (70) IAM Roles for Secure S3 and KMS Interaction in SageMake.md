A Machine Learning Specialist uploads a dataset to an Amazon S3 bucket protected with server-side encryption using AWS KMS.  
How should the ML Specialist define the Amazon SageMaker notebook instance so it can read the same dataset from Amazon S3?  

A. Define security group(s) to allow all HTTP inbound/outbound traffic and assign those security group(s) to the Amazon SageMaker notebook instance.
B. ׀¡onfigure the Amazon SageMaker notebook instance to have access to the VPC. Grant permission in the KMS key policy to the notebook's KMS role.
C. Assign an IAM role to the Amazon SageMaker notebook with S3 read access to the dataset. Grant permission in the KMS key policy to that role.
D. Assign the same KMS key used to encrypt data in Amazon S3 to the Amazon SageMaker notebook instance.

My answer: C

You're spot on! Option C is the correct way to configure the SageMaker notebook instance to access the encrypted dataset. Here's why:

- **IAM Role:** IAM roles are the recommended way to manage AWS permissions. Assigning a role to the notebook instance with S3 read access ensures it can retrieve the data.
- **KMS Key Policy:** The role needs permission to use the KMS key that encrypts the S3 data. The KMS key policy grants this permission. This allows the instance to decrypt the data on the fly.

**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**

- **A. Security Groups:** Security groups manage network traffic, not access to specific AWS resources or encryption keys. Opening HTTP traffic is unnecessary and a security risk.
- **B. VPC Access:** While granting the notebook instance VPC access might be necessary in some network configurations, it doesn't directly address S3 object access or KMS permissions.
- **D. Assigning the KMS Key:** Assigning the KMS key directly to the instance isn't the standard way of managing permissions, and IAM roles provide a more secure and manageable approach.
