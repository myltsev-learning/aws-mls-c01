A Machine Learning Specialist is assigned a TensorFlow project using Amazon SageMaker for training, and needs to continue working for an extended period with no Wi-Fi access.  
Which approach should the Specialist use to continue working?  

A.¬†Install Python 3 and boto3 on their laptop and continue the code development using that environment.

B.¬†Download the TensorFlow Docker container used in Amazon SageMaker from GitHub to their local environment, and use the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK to test the code.

C.¬†Download TensorFlow from tensorflow.org to emulate the TensorFlow kernel in the SageMaker environment.

D.¬†Download the SageMaker notebook to their local environment, then install Jupyter Notebooks on their laptop and continue the development in a local notebook.

My answer: D

## Incorrect Answer üö´

Your answer, "D. Download the SageMaker notebook to their local environment, then install Jupyter Notebooks on their laptop and continue the development in a local notebook," is incorrect.

## Explanation üìù

The correct answer is **B. Download the TensorFlow Docker container used in Amazon SageMaker from GitHub to their local environment, and use the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK to test the code.**

Downloading the SageMaker notebook to a local environment and installing Jupyter Notebooks (as suggested in option D) is not a complete solution. While it allows you to work on the notebook locally, it does not provide the necessary environment and dependencies required for running TensorFlow code and testing it with the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK.

By downloading the TensorFlow Docker container used in Amazon SageMaker from GitHub, you can replicate the same environment locally, including all the required dependencies and libraries. Additionally, using the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK allows you to test and validate your code locally before deploying it to the SageMaker environment.

# Lesson: Working with Amazon SageMaker Locally

In this lesson, you will learn how to work with Amazon SageMaker locally, enabling you to continue development and testing even when you don't have access to the cloud environment or Wi-Fi.

1. **Docker Containers for SageMaker**:
   - Understand the role of Docker containers in Amazon SageMaker.
   - Learn how to download and set up the SageMaker Docker containers locally.
   - Explore the different Docker images available for various machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet).

2. **Amazon SageMaker Python SDK**:
   - Understand the purpose and functionality of the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK.
   - Learn how to install and configure the SDK in your local environment.
   - Explore the different modules and classes provided by the SDK for training, hosting, and managing SageMaker resources.

3. **Local Development and Testing**:
   - Learn best practices for developing and testing machine learning models locally using the SageMaker Docker containers and Python SDK.
   - Understand how to simulate the SageMaker environment locally, including data handling, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.
   - Explore techniques for debugging and troubleshooting issues in your local development environment.

4. **Deployment to SageMaker**:
   - Learn how to seamlessly transition your locally developed and tested code to the SageMaker environment for training and deployment.
   - Understand the differences between the local and cloud environments, and any necessary adjustments or configurations.

By the end of this lesson, you will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to work with Amazon SageMaker locally, enabling you to continue development and testing even in situations with limited or no internet access.
