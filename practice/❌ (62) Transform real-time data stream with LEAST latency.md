A Data Scientist wants to gain real-time insights into a data stream of GZIP files.  
Which solution would allow the use of SQL to query the stream with the LEAST latency?  

A. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics with an AWS Lambda function to transform the data.
B. AWS Glue with a custom ETL script to transform the data.
C. An Amazon Kinesis Client Library to transform the data and save it to an Amazon ES cluster.
D. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to transform the data and put it into an Amazon S3 bucket.

My answer: B

Unfortunately, option B isn't the best answer for this scenario. Let's break down why and explore the most suitable option:

This were hard day.

**The Ideal Solution: A - Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics with an AWS Lambda function to transform the data**

Here's why it excels in this case:

- **Real-Time Focus:** Kinesis Data Analytics is specifically designed for processing streaming data with very low latency, allowing you to perform near real-time SQL queries.
- **GZIP Handling:** AWS Lambda provides flexibility to write a custom function to decompress the GZIP files on the fly, making the data instantly accessible for querying.
- **SQL Queries:** Kinesis Data Analytics supports standard SQL, enabling familiar and efficient querying of the transformed data stream.

**Why Other Options Fall Short**

- **B. AWS Glue with a custom ETL script:** AWS Glue primarily focuses on batch ETL processes. While it could work, it introduces higher latency than a dedicated streaming solution like Kinesis Data Analytics.
- **C. Amazon Kinesis Client Library to transform the data and save it to an Amazon ES cluster:** This option adds complexity (using the KCL) and the extra step of storing in Elasticsearch. While it could work, direct querying on the streaming data in Kinesis Data Analytics would be more efficient.
- **D. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to transform the data and put it into an Amazon S3 bucket:** Kinesis Data Firehose is excellent for streaming to destinations but doesn't have the built-in SQL query capabilities of Kinesis Data Analytics.
