A Data Scientist is working on an application that performs sentiment analysis. The validation accuracy is poor, and the Data Scientist thinks that the cause may be a rich vocabulary and a low average frequency of words in the dataset.  
Which tool should be used to improve the validation accuracy?  

A. Amazon Comprehend syntax analysis and entity detection
B. Amazon SageMaker BlazingText cbow mode
C. Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) stemming and stop word removal
D. Scikit-leam term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer

My answer: C

While Option C (NLTK stemming and stop word removal) can be helpful in certain sentiment analysis scenarios, it might not be the most effective choice for this specific problem. Let's break down why and look at a better alternative:

**Why C might not be the best solution:**

- **Rich Vocabulary:** Stemming and stop word removal reduce complexity but can also lead to the loss of potentially valuable nuances in language, especially with a rich vocabulary.
- **Low Frequency Words:** These less frequent words may carry strong sentiment signals. Stemming them or removing them altogether risks lessening the model's discriminating power.

**A more suitable solution: D. Scikit-learn term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer**

- **TF-IDF's Importance:** TF-IDF emphasizes words that are important within a specific document (product review, etc.) but less frequent across the entire dataset. This aligns well with the scenario of rich vocabulary and low average word frequency.
- **Handling Infrequent Sentiment Words:** TF-IDF will give more weight to those less frequent words that might be strong indicators of sentiment, improving your model's ability to discern subtle meaning variations.

**Why other options are less suitable:**

- **A. Amazon Comprehend syntax analysis and entity detection:** While useful for understanding text structure, this doesn't directly address the problem of infrequent sentiment-bearing words.
- **B. Amazon SageMaker BlazingText cbow mode:** BlazingText is excellent for word embeddings, but it might not be the primary solution for the low word frequency issue.
