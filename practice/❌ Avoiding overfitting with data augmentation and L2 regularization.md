An insurance company is developing a new device for vehicles that uses a camera to observe drivers' behavior and alert them when they appear distracted. The company created approximately 10,000 training images in a controlled environment that a Machine Learning Specialist will use to train and evaluate machine learning models. During the model evaluation, the Specialist notices that the training error rate diminishes faster as the number of epochs increases and the model is not accurately inferring on the unseen test images.  

Which of the following should be used to resolve this issue? (Choose two.)  

- A.Â Add vanishing gradient to the model.
- B.Â <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Perform data augmentation on the training data.</mark>
- C.Â Make the neural network architecture complex.
- D.Â <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Use gradient checking in the model.</mark>
- E.Â <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Add L2 regularization to the model.</mark>

My answer: D, E

## Feedback on Your Answer

Your answer: D, E

### Correct Options:
- B. Perform data augmentation on the training data.
- E. Add L2 regularization to the model.

### Explanation:

ðŸš« Option D (Use gradient checking in the model) is incorrect. Gradient checking is a technique used to verify the correctness of the implementation of backpropagation, but it does not directly address the issue of overfitting or poor generalization on unseen data.

âœ… Option B (Perform data augmentation on the training data) is correct. Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size and diversity of the training data by applying various transformations (e.g., rotations, flips, crops) to the existing images. This can help the model generalize better to unseen data and reduce overfitting.

âœ… Option E (Add L2 regularization to the model) is also correct. L2 regularization (also known as weight decay) is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that encourages smaller weight values. This can help the model generalize better to unseen data.

### Prompt for Claude:

Claude, please provide a lesson on techniques to address overfitting in machine learning models, with a focus on data augmentation and regularization methods like L2 regularization. Include examples and explanations of how these techniques work and when they should be applied.

### Summary

Your answer was partially correct. You correctly identified L2 regularization as a solution, but gradient checking is not an appropriate technique for addressing the issue of overfitting or poor generalization on unseen data. Data augmentation is a more suitable approach in this case.
