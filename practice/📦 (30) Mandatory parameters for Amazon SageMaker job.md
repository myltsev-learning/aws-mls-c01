When submitting [[Amazon SageMaker|Amazon SageMaker]] training jobs using one of the built-in algorithms, which common parameters MUST be specified? (Choose three.)  

A.Â The training channel identifying the location of training data on an Amazon S3 bucket.
B.Â The validation channel identifying the location of validation data on an Amazon S3 bucket.
C.Â The IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to perform tasks on behalf of the users.
D.Â Hyperparameters in a JSON array as documented for the algorithm used.
E.Â The Amazon EC2 instance class specifying whether training will be run using CPU or GPU.
F.Â The output path specifying where on an Amazon S3 bucket the trained model will persist.

My answer: A, B, C

## Incorrect Answer

Your answer (A, B, C) is incorrect. The correct answer is: **C, E, F**.

## Documentation proof

In this documentation we can see that C, E, F are required: [CreateTrainingJob - Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrainingJob.html)

**F**
> Specifies the path to the S3 location where you want to store model artifacts. SageMaker creates subfolders for the artifacts.

**E**
> The resources, including the ML compute instances and ML storage volumes, to use for model training.

**C**
> The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that SageMaker can assume to perform tasks on your behalf.
