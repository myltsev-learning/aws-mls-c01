A Machine Learning Specialist is creating a new natural language processing application that processes a dataset comprised of 1 million sentences. The aim is to then run Word2Vec to generate embeddings of the sentences and enable different types of predictions.  
Here is an example from the dataset:  
"The quck BROWN FOX jumps over the lazy dog."

Which of the following are the operations the Specialist needs to perform to correctly sanitize and prepare the data in a repeatable manner? (Choose three.)  

A. Perform part-of-speech tagging and keep the action verb and the nouns only.
B. Normalize all words by making the sentence lowercase.
C. Remove stop words using an English stopword dictionary.
D. Correct the typography on "quck" to "quick.ג€
E. One-hot encode all words in the sentence.
F. Tokenize the sentence into words.

My answer: B, E, F

### Explanation

Your answer is incorrect. The correct options are **B, C, and F**.

Here's a detailed feedback on your answer:

**B. Normalize all words by making the sentence lowercase**: This is a correct step in data preprocessing for natural language processing tasks. Converting all text to lowercase helps to treat words like "Dog" and "dog" as the same, which is generally desirable.

**E. One-hot encode all words in the sentence**: This is an incorrect step for preparing data for Word2Vec. One-hot encoding is typically used for categorical variables in traditional machine learning models, but it is not suitable for natural language processing tasks like Word2Vec. Word2Vec aims to learn dense vector representations (embeddings) of words, which capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words.

**F. Tokenize the sentence into words**: This is a correct step. Tokenization is the process of splitting a sentence or a piece of text into individual words or tokens, which is a necessary step before applying Word2Vec or other NLP techniques.

The option you missed is:

**C. Remove stop words using an English stopword dictionary**: This is a common preprocessing step in NLP tasks. Stop words are common words like "the," "a," "is," etc., that carry little meaning and can be removed to reduce noise and improve the performance of NLP models.

**Lesson Prompt:** To learn more about the appropriate preprocessing techniques for natural language processing tasks, teach me on "Natural Language Processing Preprocessing Techniques." This lesson should cover topics such as tokenization, normalization, stop word removal, and text representation techniques like word embeddings and TF-IDF.
