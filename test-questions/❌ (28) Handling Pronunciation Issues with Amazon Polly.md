### Feedback

Your answer: C. Output speech marks to guide in pronunciation.

This answer is **incorrect**. ðŸ˜”

**Explanation:**
Speech marks or punctuation marks do not provide guidance for pronunciation of specific words or acronyms. They are used for other purposes, such as indicating quotations or pauses in speech.

The correct answer is: **B. Create an appropriate pronunciation lexicon.** ðŸŽ¯

A pronunciation lexicon is a file that provides phonetic transcriptions and guidance on how to pronounce specific words or phrases, including acronyms. By creating a pronunciation lexicon with the correct pronunciations for the company acronyms, Amazon Polly can accurately pronounce them in the synthesized speech.
